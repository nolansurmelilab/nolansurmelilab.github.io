  abstract = {Interactions between excitatory and inhibitory neurons are critical to computations in cortical circuits but their organization is difficult to assess with standard electrophysiological approaches. Within the medial entorhinal cortex, representation of location by grid and other spatial cells involves circuits in layer 2 in which excitatory stellate cells interact with each other via inhibitory parvalbumin expressing interneurons. Whether this connectivity is structured to support local circuit computations is unclear. Here, we introduce strategies to address the functional organization of excitatory-inhibitory interactions using crossed Cre- and Flp-driver mouse lines to direct targeted presynaptic optogenetic activation and postsynaptic cell identification. We then use simultaneous patch-clamp recordings from postsynaptic neurons to assess their shared input from optically activated presynaptic populations. We find that extensive axonal projections support spatially organized connectivity between stellate cells and parvalbumin interneurons, such that direct connections are often, but not always, shared by nearby neurons, whereas multisynaptic interactions coordinate inputs to neurons with greater spatial separation. We suggest that direct excitatory-inhibitory synaptic interactions may operate at the scale of grid cell clusters, with local modules defined by excitatory-inhibitory connectivity, while indirect interactions may coordinate activity at the scale of grid cell modules.},

 abstract = {Grid firing fields have been proposed as a neural substrate for spatial localisation in general or for path integration in particular. To distinguish these possibilities, we investigate firing of grid and non-grid cells in the mouse medial entorhinal cortex during a location memory task. We find that grid firing can either be anchored to the task environment, or can encode distance travelled independently of the task reference frame. Anchoring varied between and within sessions, while spatial firing of non-grid cells was either coherent with the grid population, or was stably anchored to the task environment. We took advantage of the variability in task-anchoring to evaluate whether and when encoding of location by grid cells might contribute to behaviour. We find that when reward location is indicated by a visual cue, performance is similar regardless of whether grid cells are task-anchored or not, arguing against a role for grid representations when location cues are available. By contrast, in the absence of the visual cue, performance was enhanced when grid cells were anchored to the task environment. Our results suggest that anchoring of grid cells to task reference frames selectively enhances performance when path integration is required.},

 abstract = {In fragile X syndrome (FX), the leading monogenic cause of autism,
excessive neuronal protein synthesis is a core pathophysiology; however,
an overall increase in protein expression is not observed. Here, we
tested whether excessive protein synthesis drives a compensatory rise in
protein degradation that is protective for FX mouse model (Fmr1-/y)
neurons. Surprisingly, although we find a significant increase in
protein degra-dation through ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS), this
contributes to pathological changes. Normalizing proteasome activity
with bortezomib corrects excessive hippocampal protein synthesis and
hyperactivation of neurons in the inferior colliculus (IC) in response
to auditory stimulation. Moreover, systemic administration of bortezomib
significantly reduces the incidence and severity of audiogenic seizures
(AGS) in the Fmr1-/y mouse, as does genetic reduction of proteasome,
specifically in the IC. Together, these results identify excessive
activation of the UPS pathway in Fmr1-/y neurons as a contributor to
multiple phenotypes that can be targeted for therapeutic intervention.},

 abstract = {Standard models for spatial and episodic memory suggest that the lateral
entorhinal cortex (LEC) and medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) send parallel
independent inputs to the hippocampus, each carrying different types of
information. Here, we evaluate the possibility that information is
integrated between divisions of the entorhinal cortex prior to reaching
the hippocampus. We demonstrate that, in mice, fan cells in layer 2 (L2)
of LEC that receive neocortical inputs, and that project to the
hippocampal dentate gyrus, also send axon collaterals to layer 1 (L1) of
the MEC. Activation of inputs from fan cells evokes monosynaptic
glutamatergic excitation of stellate and pyramidal cells in L2 of the
MEC, typically followed by inhibition that contains fast and slow
components mediated by GABA(A) and GABA(B) receptors, respectively.
Inputs from fan cells also directly activate interneurons in L1 and L2
of MEC, with synaptic connections from L1 interneurons accounting for
slow feedforward inhibition of L2 principal cell populations. The
relative strength of excitation and inhibition following fan cell
activation differs substantially between neurons and is largely
independent of anatomical location. Our results demonstrate that the
LEC, in addition to directly influencing the hippocampus, can activate
or inhibit major hippocampal inputs arising from the MEC. Thus, local
circuits in the superficial MEC may combine spatial information with
sensory and higher order signals from the LEC, providing a substrate for
integration of `what' and `where' components of episodic memories.},

 abstract = {Neurons in the retrohippocampal cortices play crucial roles in spatial
memory. Many retrohippocampal neu-rons have firing fields that are
selectively active at specific locations, with memory for rewarded
locations associated with reorganization of these firing fields. Whether
this is the sole strategy for representing spatial memories is unclear.
Here, we demonstrate that during a spatial memory task retrohippocampal
neurons encode location through ramping activity that extends across
segments of a linear track approaching and following a reward, with the
rewarded location represented by offsets or switches in the slope of the
ramping activity. Ramping representations could be maintained
independently of trial outcome and cues marking the reward location,
indicating that they result from recall of the track structure. When
recorded in an open arena, neurons that generated ramping activity
during the spatial memory task were more numerous than grid or border
cells, with a majority showing spatial firing that did not meet criteria
for classification as grid or border representations. Encoding of
rewarded locations through offsets and switches in the slope of ramping
activ-ity also emerged in recurrent neural network models trained to
solve a similar spatial memory task. Impaired performance of model
networks following disruption of outputs from ramping neurons is
consistent with this coding strategy supporting navigation to recalled
locations of behavioral significance. Our results suggest that encoding
of learned spaces by retrohippocampal networks employs both discrete
firing fields and continuous ramping representations. We hypothesize
that retrohippocampal ramping activity mediates readout of learned
models for goal-directed navigation.},

require high precision spatiotemporal measurements of neural activity.
Recently developed genetically encoded voltage indicators (GEVIs) report
both spiking and subthreshold activity of identified neurons. However,
maximally capitalizing on the potential of GEVIs will require imaging at
millisecond time scales, which remains challenging with standard camera
systems. Here, application of single photon avalanche diode (SPAD)
sensors is reported to image neural activity at kilohertz frame rates.
SPADs are electronic devices that when activated by a single photon
cause an avalanche of electrons and a large electric current. An array
of SPAD sensors is used to image individual neurons expressing the GEVI
Voltron-JF525-HTL. It is shown that subthreshold and spiking activity
can be resolved with shot noise limited signals at frame rates of up to
10 kHz. SPAD imaging is able to reveal millisecond scale synchronization
of neural activity in an ex vivo seizure model. SPAD sensors may have
widespread applications for investigation of millisecond timescale
neural dynamics.},

 abstract = {Accurate decoding of neural signals often requires assigning
extracellular waveforms acquired on the same electrode to their
originating neurons, a process known as spike sorting. While many
offline sorters are available, accurate online sorting of spikes with
many channels is still a challenging problem. Existing online sorters
either use simple algorithms with low accuracy, can only process a
handful of channels, or depend on a complex runtime environment that is
difficult to set up. We have developed a state-of-the-art online spike
sorting platform in Python that enables large-scale, fully automatic
real-time spike sorting and decoding on hundreds of channels. Our system
is cross-platform and works seamlessly with the Open Ephys suite of
open-source hardware and software widely used in many neuroscience
laboratories worldwide. It also comes with a user-friendly graphical
user interface to monitor the cluster quality, spike waveforms and
neuronal firing rate. Our platform has comparable accuracy to offline
sorters and can achieve an end-to-end sorting latency of around 160 ms
for 128-channel signals. It will be useful for research in fundamental

 abstract = {Complementary actions of the neocortex and the hippocampus enable encoding and long-term storage of experience dependent memories. Standard models for memory storage assume that sensory signals reach the hippocampus from superficial layers of the entorhinal cortex (EC). Deep layers of the EC on the other hand relay hippocampal outputs to the telencephalic structures including many parts of the neocortex. Here, we show that cells in layer 5a of the medial EC send a copy of their telencephalic outputs back to the CA1 region of the hippocampus. Combining cell-type-specific anatomical tracing with high-throughput RNA-sequencing based projection mapping and optogenetics aided circuit mapping, we show that in the mouse brain these projections have a unique topography and target hippocampal pyramidal cells and interneurons. Our results suggest that projections of deep medial EC neurons are anatomically configured to influence the hippocampus and neocortex simultaneously and therefore lead to novel hypotheses on the functional role of the deep EC.},

 abstract = {The deep layers of the entorhinal cortex are important for spatial
cognition, as well as memory storage, consolidation and retrieval. A
long-standing hypothesis is that deep-layer neurons relay spatial and
memory-related signals between the hippocampus and telencephalon. We
review the implications of recent circuit-level analyses that suggest
more complex roles. The organization of deep entorhinal layers is
consistent with multi-stage processing by specialized cell populations;
in this framework, hippocampal, neocortical, and subcortical inputs are
integrated to generate representations for use by targets in the
telencephalon and for feedback to the superficial entorhinal cortex and
hippocampus. Addressing individual sublayers of the deep entorhinal
cortex in future experiments and models will be important for
establishing systems-level mechanisms for spatial cognition and episodic
memory.},

 abstract = {Seizures can emerge from multiple or large foci in temporal lobe
epilepsy, complicating focally targeted strategies such as surgical
resection or the modulation of the activity of specific hippocampal
neuronal populations through genetic or optogenetic techniques. Here, we
evaluate a strategy in which optogenetic activation of medial septal
GABAergic neurons, which provide extensive projections throughout the
hippocampus, is used to control seizures. We utilized the chronic
intrahippocampal kainate mouse model of temporal lobe epilepsy, which
results in spontaneous seizures and as is often the case in human
patients, presents with hippocampal sclerosis. Medial septal GABAergic
neuron populations were immunohistochemically labelled and were not
reduced in epileptic conditions. Genetic labelling with mRuby of medial
septal GABAergic neuron synaptic puncta and imaging across the rostral
to caudal extent of the hippocampus, also indicated an unchanged number
of putative synapses in epilepsy. Furthermore, optogenetic stimulation
of medial septal GABAergic neurons consistently modulated oscillations
across multiple hippocampal locations in control and epileptic
conditions. Finally, wireless optogenetic stimulation of medial septal
GABAergic neurons, upon electrographic detection of spontaneous
hippocampal seizures, resulted in reduced seizure durations. We propose
medial septal GABAergic neurons as a novel target for optogenetic
control of seizures in temporal lobe epilepsy.},

 abstract = {Grid and head direction codes represent cognitive spaces for navigation
and memory. Pure grid cells generate grid codes that have been assumed
to be independent of head direction, whereas conjunctive cells generate
grid representations that are tuned to a single head direction. Here, we
demonstrate that pure grid cells also encode head direction, but through
distinct mechanisms. We show that individual firing fields of pure grid
cells are tuned to multiple head directions, with the preferred sets of
directions differing between fields. This local directional modulation
is not predicted by previous continuous attractor or oscillatory
interference models of grid firing but is accounted for by models in
which pure grid cells integrate inputs from co-aligned conjunctive cells
with firing rates that differ between their fields. We suggest that
local directional signals from grid cells may contribute to downstream
computations by decorrelating different points of view from the same
location. Neurons with grid firing fields are thought to play important
roles in spatial cognition. Here, the authors show that in contrast to
assumptions underlying current models and analyses, grid fields are
modulated by local head direction; this suggests different mechanisms
and new roles for grid firing.},

nervous system function. Functional variation also exists between
neurons of the same type. This is exemplified by correspondence between
grid cell spatial scales and the synaptic integrative properties of
stellate cells (SCs) in the medial entorhinal cortex. However, we know
little about how functional variability is structured either within or
between individuals. Using ex-vivo patch-clamp recordings from up to 55
SCs per mouse, we found that integrative properties vary between mice
and, in contrast to the modularity of grid cell spatial scales, have a
continuous dorsoventral organization. Our results constrain mechanisms
for modular grid firing and provide evidence for inter-animal phenotypic
variability among neurons of the same type. We suggest that neuron type
properties are tuned to circuit-level set points that vary within and

 abstract = {Episodic memory requires different types of information to be bound
together to generate representations of experiences. The lateral
entorhinal cortex (LEC) and hippocampus are required for episodic like
memory in rodents {[}1, 2]. The LEC is critical for integrating spatial
and contextual information about objects {[}236]. Further, LEC neurons
encode objects in the environment and the locations where objects were
previously experienced and generate representations of time during the
encoding and retrieval of episodes {[}7312]. However, it remains unclear
how specific populations of cells within the LEC contribute to the
integration of episodic memory components. Layer 2 (L2) of LEC manifests
early pathology in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related animal models
{[}13-16]. Projections to the hippocampus from L2 of LEC arise from fan
cells in a superficial sub -layer (L2a) that are immunoreactive for
reelin and project to the dentate gyrus {[}17, 18]. Here, we establish
an approach for selectively targeting fan cells using Siml:Cre mice.
Whereas complete lesions of the LEC were previously found to abolish
associative recognition memory {[}2, 3], we report that, after selective
suppression of synaptic output from fan cells, mice can discriminate
novel object-context configurations but are impaired in recognition of
novel object-place-context associations. Our results suggest that memory
functions are segregated between distinct LEC networks.},

 abstract = {Cerebellar climbing-fiber-mediated complex spikes originate from neurons
in the inferior olive (IO), are critical for motor coordination, and are
central to theories of cerebellar learning. Hyperpolarization-activated
cyclic-nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels expressed by IO neurons have been
considered as pacemaker currents important for oscillatory and resonant
dynamics. Here, we demonstrate that in vitro, network actions of HCN1
channels enable bidirectional glutamatergic synaptic responses, while
local actions of HCN1 channels determine the timing and waveform of
synaptically driven action potentials. These roles are distinct from,
and may complement, proposed pacemaker functions of HCN channels. We
find that in behaving animals HCN1 channels reduce variability in the
timing of cerebellar complex spikes, which serve as a readout of IO
spiking. Our results suggest that spatially distributed actions of HCN1
channels enable the IO to implement network-wide rules for synaptic
integration that modulate the timing of cerebellar climbing fiber
signals.},

 abstract = {Spatial learning requires estimates of location that may be obtained by
path integration or from positional cues. Grid and other spatial firing
patterns of neurons in the superficial medial entorhinal cortex (MEC)
suggest roles in behavioral estimation of location. However,
distinguishing the contributions of path integration and cue-based
signals to spatial behaviors is challenging, and the roles of identified
MEC neurons are unclear. We use virtual reality to dissociate linear
path integration from other strategies for behavioral estimation of
location. We find that mice learn to path integrate using motor-related
self-motion signals, with accuracy that decreases steeply as a function
of distance. We show that inactivation of stellate cells in superficial
MEC impairs spatial learning in virtual reality and in a real world
object location recognition task. Our results quantify contributions of
path integration to behavior and corroborate key predictions of models
in which stellate cells contribute to location estimation.},

events extended across time and space. However, the mechanisms
underlying the numerous and diverse experimentally observed properties

sequences using a novel model constrained by the septo-hippocampal
circuitry. We show that when spontaneously active interneurons integrate
spatial signals and theta frequency pacemaker inputs, they generate
phase precessing action potentials that can coordinate theta sequences
in place cell populations. We reveal novel constraints on sequence
generation, predict cellular properties and neural dynamics that
characterize sequence compression, identify circuit organization
principles for high capacity sequential representation, and show that
theta sequences can be used as substrates for association of conditioned
stimuli with recent and upcoming events. Our results suggest mechanisms
for flexible sequence compression that are suited to associative

 abstract = {The inferior olive plays a critical role in motor coordination and
learning by integrating diverse afferent signals to generate climbing
fibre inputs to the cerebellar cortex. While it is well established that
climbing fibre signals are important for motor coordination, the
mechanisms by which neurones in the inferior olive integrate synaptic
inputs and the roles of particular ion channels are unclear. Here, we
test the hypothesis that neurones in the inferior olive actively
integrate glutamatergic synaptic inputs. We demonstrate that
optogenetically activated long-range synaptic inputs to the inferior
olive, including projections from the motor cortex, generate rapid
excitatory potentials followed by slower inhibitory potentials. Synaptic
projections from the motor cortex preferentially target the principal
olivary nucleus. We show that inhibitory and excitatory components of
the bidirectional synaptic potentials are dependent upon AMPA (GluA)
receptors, are GABA(A) independent, and originate from the same
presynaptic axons. Consistent with models that predict active
integration of synaptic inputs by inferior olive neurones, we find that
the inhibitory component is reduced by blocking large conductance
calcium-activated potassium channels with iberiotoxin, and is abolished
by blocking small conductance calcium-activated potassium channels with
apamin. Summation of excitatory components of synaptic responses to
inputs at intervals 20ms is increased by apamin, suggesting a role for
the inhibitory component of glutamatergic responses in temporal
integration. Our results indicate that neurones in the inferior olive
implement novel rules for synaptic integration and suggest new
principles for the contribution of inferior olive neurones to
coordinated motor behaviours.},

 abstract = {Neurons in the medial entorhinal cortex encode location through spatial
firing fields that have a grid-like organisation. The challenge of
identifying mechanisms for grid firing has been addressed through
experimental and theoretical investigations of medial entorhinal
circuits. Here, we discuss evidence for continuous attractor network
models that account for grid firing by synaptic interactions between
excitatory and inhibitory cells. These models assume that grid-like
firing patterns are the result of computation of location from velocity
inputs, with additional spatial input required to oppose drift in the
attractor state. We focus on properties of continuous attractor networks
that are revealed by explicitly considering excitatory and inhibitory
neurons, their connectivity and their membrane potential dynamics.
Models at this level of detail can account for theta-nested gamma
oscillations as well as grid firing, predict spatial firing of
interneurons as well as excitatory cells, show how gamma oscillations
can bemodulated independently from spatial computations, reveal critical
roles for neuronal noise, and demonstrate that only a subset of
excitatory cells in a network need have grid-like firing fields.
Evaluating experimental data against predictions from detailed network
models will be important for establishing the mechanisms mediating grid
firing.},

 abstract = {Deep layers of the medial entorhinal cortex are considered to relay
signals from the hippocampus to other brain structures, but pathways for
routing of signals to and from the deep layers are not well established.
Delineating these pathways is important for a circuit level
understanding of spatial cognition and memory. We find that neurons in
layers 5a and 5b have distinct molecular identities, defined by the
transcription factors Etv1 and Ctip2, and divergent targets, with
extensive intratelencephalic projections originating in layer 5a, but
not 5b. This segregation of outputs is mirrored by the organization of
glutamatergic input from stellate cells in layer 2 and from the
hippocampus, with both preferentially targeting layer 5b over 5a. Our
results suggest a molecular and anatomical organization of input-output
computations in deep layers of the MEC, reveal precise translaminar
microcircuitry, and identify molecularly defined pathways for spatial
signals to influence computation in deep layers.},

 abstract = {Neural computations underlying cognitive functions require calibration
of the strength of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic connections and
are associated with modulation of gamma frequency oscillations in
network activity. However, principles relating gamma oscillations,
synaptic strength and circuit computations are unclear. We address this
in attractor network models that account for grid firing and
theta-nested gamma oscillations in the medial entorhinal cortex. We show
that moderate intrinsic noise massively increases the range of synaptic
strengths supporting gamma oscillations and grid computation. With
moderate noise, variation in excitatory or inhibitory synaptic strength
tunes the amplitude and frequency of gamma activity without disrupting
grid firing. This beneficial role for noise results from disruption of
epileptic-like network states. Thus, moderate noise promotes independent
control of multiplexed firing rate-and gamma-based computational
mechanisms. Our results have implications for tuning of normal circuit
function and for disorders associated with changes in gamma oscillations
and synaptic strength.},

location through sequences of action potentials generated within each
cycle of the network theta rhythm. These sequential representations have
been suggested to result from temporally coordinated synaptic
interactions within and between cell assemblies. Instead, we find
through simulations and analysis of experimental data that rate and
phase coding in independent neurons is sufficient to explain the
organization of CA1 population activity during theta states. We show
that CA1 population activity can be described as an evolving traveling
wave that exhibits phase coding, rate coding, spike sequences and that
generates an emergent population theta rhythm. We identify measures of
global remapping and intracellular theta dynamics as critical for
distinguishing mechanisms for pacemaking and coordination of sequential
population activity. Our analysis suggests that, unlike synaptically
coupled assemblies, independent neurons flexibly generate sequential
population activity within the duration of a single theta cycle.},

 abstract = {Neural circuits in the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) encode an animal's
position and orientation in space. Within the MEC spatial
representations, including grid and directional firing fields, have a
laminar and dorsoventral organization that corresponds to a similar
topography of neuronal connectivity and cellular properties. Yet, in
part due to the challenges of integrating anatomical data at the
resolution of cortical layers and borders, we know little about the
molecular components underlying this organization. To address this we
develop a new computational pipeline for high-throughput analysis and
comparison of in situ hybridization (ISH) images at laminar resolution.
We apply this pipeline to ISH data for over 16,000 genes in the Allen
Brain Atlas and validate our analysis with RNA sequencing of MEC tissue
from adult mice. We find that differential gene expression delineates
the borders of the MEC with neighboring brain structures and reveals its
laminar and dorsoventral organization. We propose a new molecular basis
for distinguishing the deep layers of the MEC and show that their
similarity to corresponding layers of neocortex is greater than that of
superficial layers. Our analysis identifies ion channel-, cell
adhesion-and synapse-related genes as candidates for functional
differentiation of MEC layers and for encoding of spatial information at
different scales along the dorsoventral axis of the MEC. We also reveal
laminar organization of genes related to disease pathology and suggest
that a high metabolic demand predisposes layer II to neurodegenerative
pathology. In principle, our computational pipeline can be applied to
high-throughput analysis of many forms of neuro-anatomical data. Our
results support the hypothesis that differences in gene expression
contribute to functional specialization of superficial layers of the MEC
and dorsoventral organization of the scale of spatial representations.},

 abstract = {Hypertension is associated with pathologically increased sympathetic
drive to the vasculature. This has been attributed to increased
excitatory drive to sympathetic preganglionic neurons (SPN) from
brainstem cardiovascular control centers. However, there is also
evidence supporting increased intrinsic excitability of SPN. To test
this hypothesis, we made whole cell recordings of muscle
vasoconstrictor-like (MVClike) SPN in the working-heart brainstem
preparation of spontaneously hypertensive (SH) and normotensive
Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. The MVClike SPN have a higher spontaneous
firing frequency in the SH rat (3.85 +/- 0.4 vs. 2.44 +/- 0.4 Hz in WKY;
P = 0.011) with greater respiratory modulation of their activity. The
action potentials of SH SPN had smaller, shorter afterhyperpolarizations
(AHPs) and showed diminished transient rectification indicating
suppression of an A-type potassium conductance (I-A). We developed
mathematical models of the SPN to establish if changes in their
intrinsic properties in SH rats could account for their altered firing.
Reduction of the maximal conductance density of I-A by 15-30\% changed
the excitability and output of the model from the WKY to a SH profile,
with increased firing frequency, amplified respiratory modulation, and
smaller AHPs. This change in output is predominantly a consequence of
altered synaptic integration. Consistent with these in silico
predictions, we found that intrathecal 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) increased
sympathetic nerve activity, elevated perfusion pressure, and augmented
Traube-Hering waves. Our findings indicate that I-A acts as a powerful
filter on incoming synaptic drive to SPN and that its diminution in the
SH rat is potentially sufficient to account for the increased
sympathetic output underlying hypertension.},

 abstract = {The medial septum (MS) is required for theta rhythmic oscillations and
grid cell firing in the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC). While GABAergic,
glutamatergic, and cholinergic neurons project from the MS to the MEC,
their synaptic targets are unknown. To investigate whether MSneurons
innervate specific layers and cell types in the MEC, we expressed
channelrhodopsin-2 in mouse MSneurons and used patch-clamp recording in
brain slices to determine the response to light activation of identified
cells in the MEC. Following activation of MS axons, we observed fast
monosynaptic GABAergic IPSPs in the majority (>60\%) of fast-spiking
(FS) and low-threshold-spiking (LTS) interneurons in all layers of the
MEC, but in only 1.5\% of nonstellate principal cells (NSPCs) and in no
stellate cells. We also observed fast glutamatergic responses to MS
activation in a minority (<5\%) of NSPCs, FS, and LTS interneurons.
During stimulation of MS inputs at theta frequency (10 Hz), the
amplitude of GABAergic IPSPs was maintained, and spike output from LTS
and FS interneurons was entrained at low (25-60 Hz) and high (60-180 Hz)
gamma frequencies, respectively. By demonstrating cell type-specific
targeting of the GABAergic projection from the MS to the MEC, our
results support the idea that the MS controls theta frequency activity
in the MEC through coordination of inhibitory circuits.},

 abstract = {Neural computations rely on ion channels that modify neuronal responses
to synaptic inputs. While single cell recordings suggest diverse and
neurone type-specific computational functions for HCN1 channels, their
behavioural roles in any single neurone type are not clear. Using a
battery of behavioural assays, including analysis of motor learning in
vestibulo-ocular reflex and rotarod tests, we find that deletion of HCN1
channels from cerebellar Purkinje cells selectively impairs late stages
of motor learning. Because deletion of HCN1 modifies only a subset of
behaviours involving Purkinje cells, we asked whether the channel also
has functional specificity at a cellular level. We find that HCN1
channels in cerebellar Purkinje cells reduce the duration of inhibitory
synaptic responses but, in the absence of membrane hyperpolarization, do
not affect responses to excitatory inputs. Our results indicate that
manipulation of subthreshold computation in a single neurone type causes
specific modifications to behaviour.},

 abstract = {In many cortical neurons, HCN1 channels are the major contributors to
I-h, the hyperpolarization-activated current, which regulates the
intrinsic properties of neurons and shapes their integration of synaptic
inputs, paces rhythmic activity, and regulates synaptic plasticity.
Here, we examine the physiological role of I-h in deep layer pyramidal
neurons in mouse prefrontal cortex (PFC), focusing on persistent
activity, a form of sustained firing thought to be important for the
behavioral function of the PFC during working memory tasks. We find that
HCN1 contributes to the intrinsic persistent firing that is induced by a
brief depolarizing current stimulus in the presence of muscarinic
agonists. Deletion of HCN1 or acute pharmacological blockade of I-h
decreases the fraction of neurons capable of generating persistent
firing. The reduction in persistent firing is caused by the membrane
hyperpolarization that results from the deletion of HCN1 or I-h
blockade, rather than a specific role of the hyperpolarization-activated
current in generating persistent activity. In vivo recordings show that
deletion of HCN1 has no effect on up states, periods of enhanced
synaptic network activity. Parallel behavioral studies demonstrate that
HCN1 contributes to the PFC-dependent resolution of proactive
interference during working memory. These results thus provide genetic
evidence demonstrating the importance of HCN1 to intrinsic persistent
firing and the behavioral output of the PFC. The causal role of
intrinsic persistent firing in PFC-mediated behavior remains an open
question.},

temporal codes that rely on oscillatory network activity, but the
circuit mechanisms that combine these coding schemes are unclear. We
establish with optogenetic activation of layer II of the medial
entorhinal cortex that theta frequency drive to this circuit is
sufficient to generate nested gamma frequency oscillations in synaptic
activity. These nested gamma oscillations closely resemble activity
during spatial exploration, are generated by local feedback inhibition
without recurrent excitation, and have clock-like features suitable as
reference signals for multiplexing temporal codes within rate-coded grid
firing fields. In network models deduced from our data, feedback
inhibition supports coexistence of theta-nested gamma oscillations with
attractor states that generate grid firing fields. These results
indicate that grid cells communicate primarily via inhibitory
interneurons. This circuit mechanism enables multiplexing of
oscillation-based temporal codes with rate-coded attractor states.},

 abstract = {A critical step in the assembly of the neural circuits that control
tetrapod locomotion is the specification of the lateral motor column
(LMC), a diverse motor neuron population targeting limb musculature.
Hox6 paralog group genes have been implicated as key determinants of LMC
fate at forelimb levels of the spinal cord, through their ability to
promote expression of the LMC-restricted genes Foxp1 and Raldh2 and to
suppress thoracic fates through exclusion of Hoxc9. The specific roles
and mechanisms of Hox6 gene function in LMC neurons, however, are not
known. We show that Hox6 genes are critical for diverse facets of LMC
identity and define motifs required for their in vivo specificities.
Although Hox6 genes are necessary for generating the appropriate number
of LMC neurons, they are not absolutely required for the induction of
forelimb LMC molecular determinants. In the absence of Hox6 activity,
LMC identity appears to be preserved through a diverse array of
Hox5-Hox8 paralogs, which are sufficient to reprogram thoracic motor
neurons to an LMC fate. In contrast to the apparently permissive Hox
inputs to early LMC gene programs, individual Hox genes, such as Hoxc6,
have specific roles in promoting motor neuron pool diversity within the
LMC. Dissection of motifs required for Hox in vivo specificities reveals
that either cross-repressive interactions or cooperativity with Pbx
cofactors are sufficient to induce LMC identity, with the N-terminus
capable of promoting columnar, but not pool, identity when transferred
to a heterologous homeodomain. These results indicate that Hox proteins
orchestrate diverse aspects of cell fate specification through both the
convergent regulation of gene programs regulated by many paralogs and
also more restricted actions encoded through specificity determinants in
the N-terminus.},

a major projection to the dentate gyrus. Entorhinal stellate cells are
distinguished by distinct intrinsic electrophysiological properties, but
how these properties contribute to representation of space is not yet
clear. Here, we review the ionic conductances, synaptic, and excitable
properties of stellate cells, and examine thier implication for models
of grid firing fields. We discuss why existing data are inconsistent
with models of grid fields that require stellate cells to generate
periodic oscillation. An alternate possibility is that the intrinsic
electrophysiological properties of stellate cells are tuned specifically
to control integration of synaptic input. We highlight recent evidence
that the dorsal-ventra; organization of synaptic integraiton by stellate
cells, through differences in currents mediated by HCN and leak
potassium channels, influences the corresponding organization of grid
fields. Because accurate cellular data will be important for
distinguishing mechanisms for generation of grid fields, we introduce
new date comparing properties measured with whole-cell and perforated
patch-clamp recordings. We find that clustered patterns of action
potential firing and the action potential after-hyperpolarization (AHP)
are particularly sensitive to recording condition. Neverthless, with
both methods, these properties, resting membrane properties and
resonance follow a dorsal-ventral organization. Further investigation of
the molecular basis for synaptic integration by stellate cells will be
important for understanding mechanisms for generation of grid fields.},

 abstract = {Seventy years ago George Romanes began to document the anatomical organization of the spinal motor system, uncovering a multilayered topographic plan that links the clustering and settling position of motor neurons to the spatial arrangement and biomechanical features of limb muscles. To this day, these findings have provided a structural foundation for analysis of the neural control of movement and serve as a guide for studies to explore mechanisms that direct the wiring of spinal motor circuits. In this brief essay we outline the core of Romanes's findings and place them in the context of recent studies that begin to provide insight into molecular programs that assign motor pool position and to resolve how motor neuron position shapes circuit assembly. Romanes's findings reveal how and why neuronal positioning contributes to sensory-motor connectivity and may have relevance to circuit organization in other regions of the central nervous system.},

 abstract = {Long-term synaptic plasticity requires postsynaptic influx of Ca(2+) and
is accompanied by changes in dendritic spine size. Unless Ca(2+) influx
mechanisms and spine volume scale proportionally, changes in spine size
will modify spine Ca(2+) concentrations during subsequent synaptic
activation. We show that the relationship between Ca(2+) influx and
spine volume is a fundamental determinant of synaptic stability. If
Ca(2+) influx is undercompensated for increases in spine size, then
strong synapses are stabilized and synaptic strength distributions have
a single peak. In contrast, overcompensation of Ca(2+) influx leads to
binary, persistent synaptic strengths with double-peaked distributions.
Biophysical simulations predict that CA1 pyramidal neuron spines are
undercompensating. This unifies experimental findings that weak synapses
are more plastic than strong synapses, that synaptic strengths are
unimodally distributed, and that potentiation saturates for a given
stimulus strength. We conclude that structural plasticity provides a
simple, local, and general mechanism that allows dendritic spines to
foster both rapid memory formation and persistent memory storage.},

 abstract = {Summary
Sensory-motor circuits in the spinal cord are constructed with a fine specificity that coordinates motor behavior, but the mechanisms that direct sensory connections with their motor neuron partners remain unclear. The dorsoventral settling position of motor pools in the spinal cord is known to match the distal-to-proximal position of their muscle targets in the limb, but the significance of invariant motor neuron positioning is unknown. An analysis of sensory-motor connectivity patterns in FoxP1 mutant mice, where motor neuron position has been scrambled, shows that the final pattern of sensory-motor connections is initiated by the projection of sensory axons to discrete dorsoventral domains of the spinal cord without regard for motor neuron subtype or, indeed, the presence of motor neurons. By implication, the clustering and dorsoventral settling position of motor neuron pools serve as a determinant of the pattern of sensory input specificity and thus motor coordination.

demonstrate assembly of toolbox components into lentivirus and AAV

artificial microRNA targeted against the ion channel HCN1 (HCN1 miRNA).
We show that AAV assembled to express HCN1 miRNA produces efficacious
and specific in vivo knockdown of HCN1 channels. Comparison of in vivo
viral transduction using HCN1 miRNA with mice containing a germ line
deletion of HCN1 reveals similar physiological phenotypes in cerebellar
Purkinje cells. The easy assembly and re-usability of the toolbox

 abstract = {The membrane potential dynamics of stellate neurons in layer II of the
medial entorhinal cortex are important for neural encoding of location.
Previous studies suggest that these neurons generate intrinsic
theta-frequency membrane potential oscillations, with a period that
depends on neuronal location on the dorsal-ventral axis of the medial
entorhinal cortex, and which in behaving animals could support
generation of grid-like spatial firing fields. To address the nature and
organization of this theta-like activity, we adopt the Lomb method of
least-squares spectral analysis. We demonstrate that peaks in frequency
spectra that differ significantly from Gaussian noise do not necessarily
imply the existence of a periodic oscillator, but can instead arise from
filtered stochastic noise or a stochastic random walk. We show that
theta-like membrane potential activity recorded from stellate neurons in
mature brain slices is consistent with stochastic mechanisms, but not
with generation by a periodic oscillator. The dorsal-ventral
organization of intrinsic theta-like membrane potential activity, and
the modification of this activity during block of HCN channels, both
reflect altered frequency distributions of stochastic spectral peaks,
rather than tuning of a periodic oscillator. Our results demonstrate the
importance of distinguishing periodic oscillations from stochastic
processes. We suggest that dorsal-ventral tuning of theta-like membrane
potential activity is due to differences in stochastic current
fluctuations resulting from organization of ion channels that also
control synaptic integration.},

interactions between scaffolding molecules and voltage-gated sodium
channels, but the molecular mechanisms that stabilize the AIS are poorly
understood. The neuronal isoform of Neurofascin, Nfasc186, clusters
voltage-gated sodium channels at nodes of Ranvier in myelinated nerves:
here, we investigate its role in AIS assembly and stabilization.
Inactivation of the Nfasc gene in cerebellar Purkinje cells of adult
mice causes rapid loss of Nfasc186 from the AIS but not from nodes of
Ranvier. This causes AIS disintegration, impairment of motor learning
and the abolition of the spontaneous tonic discharge typical of Purkinje
cells. Nevertheless, action potentials with a modified waveform can
still be evoked and basic motor abilities remain intact. We propose that
Nfasc186 optimizes communication between mature neurons by anchoring the
key elements of the adult AIS complex.},

 abstract = {Neuronal activity is mediated through changes in the probability of
stochastic transitions between open and closed states of ion channels.
While differences in morphology define neuronal cell types and may
underlie neurological disorders, very little is known about influences
of stochastic ion channel gating in neurons with complex morphology. We
introduce and validate new computational tools that enable efficient
generation and simulation of models containing stochastic ion channels
distributed across dendritic and axonal membranes. Comparison of five
morphologically distinct neuronal cell types reveals that when all
simulated neurons contain identical densities of stochastic ion
channels, the amplitude of stochastic membrane potential fluctuations
differs between cell types and depends on sub-cellular location. For
typical neurons, the amplitude of membrane potential fluctuations
depends on channel kinetics as well as open probability. Using a
detailed model of a hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neuron, we show that when
intrinsic ion channels gate stochastically, the probability of
initiation of dendritic or somatic spikes by dendritic synaptic input
varies continuously between zero and one, whereas when ion channels gate
deterministically, the probability is either zero or one. At
physiological firing rates, stochastic gating of dendritic ion channels
almost completely accounts for probabilistic somatic and dendritic
spikes generated by the fully stochastic model. These results suggest
that the consequences of stochastic ion channel gating differ globally
between neuronal cell-types and locally between neuronal compartments.
Whereas dendritic neurons are often assumed to behave deterministically,
our simulations suggest that a direct consequence of stochastic gating
of intrinsic ion channels is that spike output may instead be a
probabilistic function of patterns of synaptic input to dendrites.},

 abstract = {The transformation of synaptic input into patterns of spike output is a
fundamental operation that is determined by the particular complement of
ion channels that a neuron expresses. Although it is well established
that individual ion channel proteins make stochastic transitions between
conducting and non-conducting states, most models of synaptic
integration are deterministic, and relatively little is known about the
functional consequences of interactions between stochastically gating
ion channels. Here, we show that a model of stellate neurons from layer
II of the medial entorhinal cortex implemented with either stochastic or
deterministically gating ion channels can reproduce the resting membrane
properties of stellate neurons, but only the stochastic version of the
model can fully account for perithreshold membrane potential
fluctuations and clustered patterns of spike output that are recorded
from stellate neurons during depolarized states. We demonstrate that the
stochastic model implements an example of a general mechanism for
patterning of neuronal output through activity-dependent changes in the
probability of spike firing. Unlike deterministic mechanisms that
generate spike patterns through slow changes in the state of model
parameters, this general stochastic mechanism does not require retention
of information beyond the duration of a single spike and its associated
afterhyperpolarization. Instead, clustered patterns of spikes emerge in
the stochastic model of stellate neurons as a result of a transient
increase in firing probability driven by activation of HCN channels
during recovery from the spike afterhyperpolarization. Using this model,
we infer conditions in which stochastic ion channel gating may influence},

 abstract = {Neurons important for cognitive function are often classified by their
morphology and integrative properties. However, it is unclear if within
a single class of neuron these properties tune synaptic responses to the
salient features of the information that each neuron represents. We
demonstrate that for stellate neurons in layer 11 of the medial
entorhinal cortex, the waveform of postsynaptic potentials, the time
window for detection of coincident inputs, and responsiveness to gamma
frequency inputs follow a dorsal-ventral gradient similar to the
topographical organization of grid-like spatial firing fields of neurons
in this area. We provide evidence that these differences are due to a
membrane conductance gradient mediated by HCN and leak potassium
channels. These findings suggest key roles for synaptic integration in
computations carried out within the medial entorhinal cortex and imply
that tuning of neural information processing by membrane ion channels is
important for normal cognitive function.},

 abstract = {Whereas recent studies have elucidated principles for representation of
information within the entorhinal cortex, less is known about the
molecular basis for information processing by entorhinal neurons. The
HCN1 gene encodes ion channels that mediate hyperpolarization-activated
currents (I-h) that control synaptic integration and influence several
forms of learning and memory. We asked whether
hyperpolarization-activated, cation nonselective 1 (HCN1) channels
control processing of information by stellate cells found within layer
II of the entorhinal cortex. Axonal projections from these neurons form
a major component of the synaptic input to the dentate gyrus of the
hippocampus. To determine whether HCN1 channels control either the
resting or the active properties of stellate neurons, we performed
whole-cell recordings in horizontal brain slices prepared from adult
wild-type and HCN1 knock-out mice. We found that HCN1 channels are
required for rapid and full activation of hyperpolarization-activated
currents in stellate neurons. HCN1 channels dominate the membrane
conductance at rest, are not required for theta frequency (4-12 Hz)
membrane potential fluctuations, but suppress low-frequency (< 4 Hz)
components of spontaneous and evoked membrane potential activity. During
sustained activation of stellate cells sufficient for firing of repeated
action potentials, HCN1 channels control the pattern of spike output by
promoting recovery of the spike afterhyperpolarization. These data
suggest that HCN1 channels expressed by stellate neurons in layer II of
the entorhinal cortex are key molecular components in the processing of
inputs to the hippocampal dentate gyrus, with distinct integrative roles
during resting and active states.},
