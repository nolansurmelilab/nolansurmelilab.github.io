Congratulations to Li-Wen and Derek for publication of their new [paper](https://elifesciences.org/articles/92854)! They introduce new strategies for investigating the organisation of synaptic connectivity and give new insights into the structure of synaptic interactions within the superficial entorhinal cortex. Our challenge now is to figure out what this means for circuit computations and memory.
