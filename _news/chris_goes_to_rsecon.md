Our research software engineer, Chris Halcrow, volunteered at [research software engineer con 2024](https://rsecon24.society-rse.org/), held at Newcastle University. This is the biggest  meeting of RSEs anywhere in the world. Since this job title is relatively new (it was coined in 2014!), the highlight of the conference was asking people what they thought an RSE was. There were a lot of different answers! More info about RSEs can be found at the [Society of RSE website](https://society-rse.org/).
